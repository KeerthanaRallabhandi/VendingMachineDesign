Simulation of Vending Machine Design

Creating a Python GUI for Vending Machine Design Simulation 

What is a Vending Machine? 
Vending Machines are used to dispense various products like Coffee, Snacks, and Cold Drink etc. when money is inserted into it. Vending Machines are well known all over the global coverage areas. The quantity of machines in these countries is on the top worldwide. This is due to the modern lifestyles which require fast food processing with high quality.

Operation of Vending Machine:

I. When the user puts in money, money counter tells the control unit, the amount of money inserted in the Vending Machine.

II. When the user presses the button to purchase the item that they want, the control unit turns on the motor and dispenses the product if correct amount is inserted.

III. If there is any change, machine will return it to the user.

IV. The machine will demand for servicing when the products are not available inside the machine.

Hence creating a software simulation of the Vending Machine has been designed using the following steps:
1. creating a tKinter master window for creating the gui
2. adding the buttons of the items for the user preference selection
3. creating an inventory stock csv acting as a database for items being displayed
4. creating an add to cart for multiple item selection
5. Displaying the out of stock message in case of the item is on short from the inventory
6. checkout of the cart using the Total bill button to display the total amount and accept the cash from the user
7. In case of Cash submit
    
    -- if exact total/extra amount  given by user then display of appropriate message with/without change to be returned

outcome: User Friendly GUI simulation for dispensing items using Vending Machine design

Following are the Software and IDE Requirements:
1. IDE used- Pycharm
2. Python version : 3.9
3. Modules used - Tkinter, pandas, PIL
